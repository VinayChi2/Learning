Mounting: attaching files to the file system ,so that we can use those files in that filesystem

in general our machine as C:/ file system(generally it contains some softwares to run) 
                          D:/  file system


if you need to run some programes from D:/ file system 

we can mount(attach) Files from C to D 

    D:/>   mount C:/  <folder_name> D:/


for unmount we use umount

Example : Existing File System

         /(root)
           |
           users
           /   \
          Bill  vinay 
                   \
                    Kumar


Unmounted Volume :

         A
        / \
       B   C


we want to attach Unmounted volume filesystem to "vinay" (Mount Point) 


after Mounting :

         /(root)
           |
           users
           /   \
          Bill  vinay   
                   / \
                  B   C


                   
Filesystem    GB blocks      Used      Free %Used Mounted on
/dev/hd4           5.00      1.20      3.80   25% /
/dev/hd2          15.00     10.28      4.72   69% /usr

/dev/hd4 is a hard disk type it can be attach(mount) to our convient serever location like / and /usr

from that mount point we are using that file system in our server


It is line EFS in cloud (multiple servers can manage the EFS simultaenously at once
                          by attaching the EFS to our server mount point)
